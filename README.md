Drone Project Code Python Script and Other Files

Drone script taken directly from https://github.com/thien94/vision_to_mavros/blob/master/scripts/t265_to_mavlink.py
and adapted to use dronekit and without some extra features, make sure that code is understood before this one, as it is more complete. 

When Debug Enabled in the script, messages are printed to console, and t265 data is logged to text file. The other python file t265graph.py, where the filename of the text file in the first line of code can be changed to graph the t265 xyz data.
